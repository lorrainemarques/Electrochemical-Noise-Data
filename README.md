# Electrochemical-Noise-Data
This database contains two groups of Electrochemical Noise obtained through electrochemical cells. One is the electrochemical noise dataset (voltage and current) of four different corrosive states: crevice, pitting, passivation and watermark. The AISI 1040 steel electrodes were immersed for 24 hours in passivation solution Na3PO4 with concentration of 0.02 M (mol/L), after, the NaCl solution was added with a concentration of 0.34 M to start the experiment in aggressive solution. The other group consists of ECN data (only potential) of AISI 1020 steel immersed in different solutions of corrosive agents, which are common in industrial environments, with three different concentrations, namely: KCl, NaOH, KOH, NaCl, FeCl3 and H2SO4.
