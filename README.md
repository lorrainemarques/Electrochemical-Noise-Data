# Electrochemical-Noise-Data
This database contains two groups of Electrochemical Noise. One is the electrochemical noise dataset (voltage and current) of four different corrosive states: crevice, pitting, passivation and watermark. The other group consists of ECN data (only potential) of AISI 1020 steel immersed in different solutions of corrosive agents and concentration, namely:KCl, NaOH, KOH, NaCl, FeCl3 and H2SO4.
